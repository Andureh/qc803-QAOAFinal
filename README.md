# QAOA Portfolio Optimization

This project explores the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to the Portfolio Optimization problem. We analyze the performance of various classical optimizers (COBYLA, SPSA, POWELL) and investigate the impact of noise, circuit depth, and penalty factors on solution quality.

This repository is structured as a Python package to support the analysis performed in `final_report.ipynb`.
